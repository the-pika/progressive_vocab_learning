# 🧠 Progressive Vocabulary Learning via Readability-Aware Clustering

This repository implements the framework presented in our paper:

**"Progressive Vocabulary Learning via Pareto-Optimal Clustering"**

It provides a complete pipeline for generating, optimizing, and clustering text variants to support progressive vocabulary learning, with a focus on interpretability and educational usability.
